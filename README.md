# Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that analyzes electricity consumption data to predict abnormal usage patterns. It utilizes machine learning models to detect irregularities based on environmental and past consumption data.

# Features
- ## Data Visualization: 
 Interactive plots to explore electricity consumption trends.
- ## Anomaly Detection:
 Machine learning-based classification of normal and abnormal power consumption.
- ## User-Friendly Interface:
  Streamlit-powered web app for easy interaction.
- ## Dataset: 
The dataset includes the following features:
- Electricity_Consumed – Power consumption data.
- Temperature – Ambient temperature readings.
- Humidity – Humidity levels.
- Wind_Speed – Wind conditions affecting power usage.
- Avg_Past_Consumption – Historical consumption trends.
